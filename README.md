This is a tool to help with learning case declension for Russian nouns.

It's a work in progress.

Objectives:

 * help you form sentences without having to have already learned every form
   of my/your/our, I/you/he/she, and every other pronoun

 * help you know what prepositions belong with what case

And perhaps more in future!
